# DataCleaning Practice With Pandas

I discovered that sitting with a real dataset and going carefully through it was the best method for me to ease myself deeper into Python for data analysis. I started a new Jupyter notebook and downloaded a tiny practice file. Without  pressure, it was just me, the data, and a little curiosity.

I installed Pandas and Numpy, loaded the dataset into the Jupyter notebook and familiarized myself with the columns. I looked for missing values, attempted to determine the source, and then gradually filled them up. The date column's datatype was changed to a date datatype after I examined the dataset datatypes and found that it was an object. The dataset felt a little more honest once I searched for duplicates and removed them as well.

I was reminded of why I like data while working through this little project. Taking a disorganized table and gradually making it clearer has a calming effect. You come to trust the process. And each time, you gain a little more confidence in your own judgment.

# What is inside
1. A raw dataset
2. My notebook with all the cleaning steps
3. A screenshot of a part of my notebook
4. A cleaned version of the final data

# How To Use It
Run the cells in the correct order after opening the notebook. Everything remains self-contained and straightforward. No difficult setup. All you need is a little patience and pandas.

This is my first Python data analytics project on GitHub, and being honest, it feels fantastic to share something at last. A humble start, but a start nonetheless.
